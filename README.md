# sidecar-starter-pack

This library provides authentication, API, and control utilities for **FarmBot sidecars**. A **sidecar** is another computer such as a Raspberry Pi, laptop, or server that you are in full control of to install your own packages onto and run your own code, unlocking what cannot be done using FarmBot OS or the web app alone. For example, a sidecar could:

- Extend the capabilities of your FarmBot with specialized hardware such as a GPU, or a camera or other sensor requiring special drivers.
- Expose your FarmBot's hardware capabilities as a device in a larger ecosystem such as one for home automation or scientific research.
- Perform more advanced manipulation of your web app account's data which may be infeasible using the frontend interface.

## :computer: Installation (Mac OS)

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

(1) Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/FarmBot-Labs/sidecar-starter-pack
```

(2) Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd sidecar-starter-pack
```

(3) Create a virtual environment.
```
python -m venv py_venv
```

(4) Activate the virtual environment.
```
source py_venv/bin/activate
```

(5) Install the required libraries within venv:
```
python -m pip install requests paho-mqtt
```

## :seedling: Getting Started

Import `main` and create an instance of the Farmbot class:
```
from main import Farmbot
bot = Farmbot()
```

### Get your authentication token

Use the same login credentials associated with the web app account you are interacting with. The server is "https://my.farm.bot" by default.
```
bot.get_token("email", "password")
```

### Configure function output verbosity

Set the level of verbosity of function outputs to change the level of information shown when functions are called.
```
bot.set_verbosity(2)
```

| Verbosity | Example using `e_stop()` |
| :--- | :--- |
| `0` The function will return with no output. | No output. |
| `1` The name of the function will be output. | `e_stop called` |
| `2` The name of the function will be output with additional information about the return value. | `Triggered device emergency stop at: 2024-08-21 11:16:18.547813` |

### Test 1: Add a new plant to your garden

This test will help familiarize you with sending commands via the [API](https://developer.farm.bot/docs/rest-api).
```
new_cabbage = {
    "name": "Cabbage",              # Point name
    "pointer_type": "Plant",        # Point type
    "x": 400,                       # x-coordinate
    "y": 300,                       # y-coordinate
    "z": 0,                         # z-coordinate
    "openfarm_slug": "cabbage",     # Plant type
    "plant_stage": "planned",       # Point status
}

bot.api_post("points", new_cabbage) # Add plant to endpoint
```

### Test 2: Turn your LED strip on and off

This test will help familiarize you with sending commands via the [Message Broker](https://developer.farm.bot/docs/message-broker).
```
bot.on(7)           # Turn ON pin 7 (LED strip)
bot.wait(2000)      # Wait 2000 milliseconds
bot.off(7)          # Turn OFF pin 7 (LED strip)
```

## :toolbox: Developer Info

### Formatting message broker messages

> [!NOTE]
> Messages sent via the message broker contain [CeleryScript nodes](https://developer.farm.bot/docs/nodes) which require special formatting.

```
message = {
    "kind": "rpc_request",
    "args": {
        "label": # node,
        "priority": # number
    },
    "body": [
        {
            # instructions
        }
    ]
}
```

### Local development

If you are working on the sidecar-starter-pack itself, ensure any changes pass all tests before submitting a pull request.

```
python -m pip install coverage
coverage run -m unittest discover
```

Additionally, you can check for test coverage by running `coverage html` and opening `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser.
